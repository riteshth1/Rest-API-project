<h1>.NET 8 Web API - Clean Architecture Example</h1>

<p>
  This project demonstrates <strong>Clean Architecture principles</strong> with user registration and login functionality.
  The API uses <strong>JWT</strong> for authentication and authorization, and stores user data in an
  <strong>in-memory database</strong> for easy development and testing. Dependency injection is used throughout
  the project for better maintainability. <strong>Swagger UI</strong> is enabled for interactive API exploration
  and testing.
